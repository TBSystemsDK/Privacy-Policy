##Data Deletion

You have the right to request the deletion of your personal information that we have collected and stored. You can do this by sending us a request at info@lazyhome.hu.

Upon receiving your request, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and confirm that you are the person who owns the personal information in question. We will then delete your personal information from our systems, unless we are required by law or have a legitimate reason to retain it.

Please note that while we will make every effort to delete your personal information as requested, it may not be possible to completely delete all copies of your information from our systems or from the systems of third parties with whom we have shared your information.

We also want to remind you that, as a user of our app, you have the ability to delete your own data by going to the settings of the app and following the instructions for data deletion.
